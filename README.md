Personal Research 

The focus of the research included testing the hypothesis of creating an equally-weighted portfolio of 25 stocks, which all are within the S&P at the start of the period, that have outperformed their counterparts within the last 6-months "Stock Generation Period" and then holding onto them for another 6-months "Stock Holding Period". Hereby, the results have been rather positive, with only one period within the total 59 period being negative

-- Usage of a more limited approach to stock picking instead of only using the S&P averages.

The values of stocks are given on additional percentage-base e.g. 0.40 is equal to an increase of 40% of the initial value.
Hereby, within the .ipynb we can see the 25 stocks selected at any given interval.
